    this file is for us to pass notes back and forth for implementation needs of our project

    Django Notes:
        avoid naming projects after built-in Python or Django components. NO "Django" or "test"

        The outer :file:`mysite/` root directory is just a container for our Django project.

        `manage.py`: A command-line utility that lets us interact with this Django project in various ways.
            more details on django git in: docs/ref/django-admin

        The inner :file:`mysite/` directory is the actual Python package for your project. Its name is the
        Python package name you'll need to use to import anything inside it (e.g. ``mysite.urls``).

        :file:`mysite/settings.py`: Settings/configuration for this Django project.  :doc:`/topics/settings`
        will tell you all about how settings work.

        file:`mysite/urls.py`: The URL declarations for this Django project; a "table of contents" of your
        Django-powered site. You can read more about URLs on git: docs/topics/http/urls`.

        file:`mysite/wsgi.py`: An entry-point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve your project.
        See docs/howto/deployment/wsgi/index` for more details.

            How to run the test server and web page:
                   Change into the outer :file:`mysite` directory:
                   RUN:     python manage.py runserver
                   OUTPUT:
                    Performing system checks...

                    System check identified no issues (0 silenced).

                    You have 14 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations
                    for app(s): admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions. Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.

                    Django version 2.0.4, using settings 'mysite.settings'
                    Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
                    Quit the server with CTRL-BREAK.

            "click" http://127.0.0.1:8000/
                this should start a web page containing a test which verifies the local server is up and running a web page.
